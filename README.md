# rejected.in

 one day when I was surfing the web and came across a website called rejected.us 
 It is a website that contains the testmonials of people who have been rejected by great organisations but are now doing some great work at great organisations. Since I am also going through the process of interviews and rejections I was highly motivated by it. Then I decided that something similar could be made for the Indian Community as well and I set out to build that myself :)

Planning to make the website live super soon ! ðŸ’¯
